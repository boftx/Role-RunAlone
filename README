Role-RunAlone

This Role provides a simple way for a command line script that uses C<Moo>
to ensure that only a single instance of said script is able to run at
one time. This is accomplished by trying to obtain an exlusive lock on the
sctript's C<__DATA__> or C<__END__> section.

The Role will call C<exit(2)> if neither of those tags are present.
This behavior can not be disabled and occurs when the Role is composed.

If one of the aforementioned tags are present, a failure to obtain an
exclusive lock indicates that another instance of the composing script
is already executing and the Role will call C<exit(1)>.
